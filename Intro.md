## Docker
Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containersâ€”standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

[Docker official reference](#https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)

### Docker technology ### 
Docker technology consists of the runtime, engine and orchestrator

*Runtime:* Responsible for starting and stopping containers.

*Daemon/Engine:* Expose the Docker remote API, manage images, volumes, networks etc.

*Orchestrator:* Manging clusters (Swarns) of nodes running docker.

## Images

An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.

## Containers
Containers are executable units of software in which application code is packaged, along with its libraries and dependencies, in common ways so that it can be run anywhere, whether it be on desktop, traditional IT, or the cloud.

[Your basic isolated Docker process](http://etherealmind.com/basics-docker-containers-hypervisors-coreos/). Containers are to Virtual Machines as threads are to processes.

A container is a runable instance of an image. Can create, start, stop, move or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.


## Volumes
Two main categories of data: Persistent and non-persistent

*Non-persistent:* Data gets written to the top layer and gets deleted with the container.

*Persistent:* Need to keep even after container deletion.

Volumes are used to persist data

Docker volumes are a widely used and useful tool for ensuring data persistence while working in containers. Docker volumes are file systems mounted on Docker containers to preserve data generated by the running container.

### Lifecycle

* [`docker create`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/create) creates a container but does not start it.
* [`docker rename`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rename/) allows the container to be renamed.
* [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run) creates and starts a container in one operation.
* [`docker rm`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rm) deletes a container.
* [`docker update`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/update/) updates a container's resource limits.

### What is the difference between Docker and Docker Compose? ###

*Docker*
Docker is a tool which is used by developer and operation teams to create and automate the deployment of applications in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently in different environments.

*Docker compose*

1. Docker Compose is used for running multiple containers as a single service
2. Here, containers run in isolation but can interact with each other
3. All Docker Compose files are YAML files
4. In Docker Compose, a user can start all the services (containers) using a single command


Docker written in *GO* language
Docker compose written in *PYTHON*
